\subsection{Infiniband-based corner turning}
For a interferometer with a bandwidth $B$, comprising $N$ elements, and a single polarisation needs to compute $8BN(N-1)/2$ operations to fully correlate the data. For the UTMOST this is $\sim$16 Tflops. The input data rate (at 8 bits) is $2BN$ which for the UTMOST is exactly 22 GBs$^{-1}$ (here G=10$^9$). These high data and computational rates necessitate the construction of massively parallel processors and in a normal hardware correlator this is usually done by constructing identical correlator ``blocks'' that each process some fraction of the total bandwidth after a ``corner turn'' that takes a series of time major order data and brings together frequency major order data for cross-correlation.

In SKAMP-2 the corner turn was to be performed on a custom mesh on each signal processing board but in the UTMOST it is performed on the servers using remote direct memory access (RDMA) transfers via FDR10 56 Gb infiniband using library calls. RDMA does not impact on the CPUs during transfers. The major advantage of a software correlator with appropriate ring buffers is that the ``timings'' that make Field Programmable Gate Array programming so difficult are eliminated.

Currently the beam-forming and DAQ machines are the same 11 computers but in the near future 8 new servers will be added with multiple GPUs per box so that UTMOST's full potential can be realised.
