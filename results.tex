\subsection{The ``Modules''}
The MOST's solution to the east-west steering problem is an ingenius system of ring antennae that are sensitive to right-hand (IEEE) circularly polarised light. The ring antennae are differentially rotated to steer the phased-array beam and coherently add incident radiation in groups of 22 antennae spanning approximately 4.7\,m. These groups of 22 antennae are referred to as ``modules", and each arm possesses 176 of them. 

In the north-south direction the telescope can tilt and observe all sources south of $\delta<+17^\circ$. The gain of an independent module is approximately 0.01 K Jy$^{-1}$ and the system temperature in the best modules is estimated to be of order 60K, although currently varies a great deal as sources of self-generated radio frequency interference are still being identified and removed. The LNAs are thought to only contribute 20-30K to the total system temperature, with the rest coming from a variety of sources including mesh leakage. The gain of each module varies in a complicated manner as it steers east-west due to the ``meridian distance gain curve'' that arises in parabolic antennae because of reflections along the cylinder that attenuate the signal so that the effective gain is $<$0.01 K Jy$^{-1}$ per module \cite{Hunstead_1996}. When added coherently all 352 modules of the antenna combine to have a gain of 3.5 K Jy$^{-1}$.
Four adjacent modules form a ``bay'' and have their independent signals passed via shielded cables to each bay's digital receiver or (RX) box. Up until the RX box the UTMOST is entirely equivalent to the old MOST. The MOST coherently added four modules together to form a ``bay'', which was filtered and brought back to the central signal processor in the control room. SKAMP-2's design sought to retain all four independent inputs from a bay, thus quadrupling the field of view, and brings back the digitized signal on optical fibres.
