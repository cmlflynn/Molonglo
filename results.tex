\section{System Design}

An block diagram of the system is provided in Figure 1. (NNED BLOCK DIAGRAM!)

\subsection{The ``Modules''}
The MOST consists of two parabolic cylinders 11.7\,m wide and 776\,m long (CHECK). This parabolic structure enables a linear scaling of cost with aperture but makes steering in the east-west direction difficult. The MOST's solution to the east-west steering problem is an ingenius systems of ring antennae that are sensitive to right-circularly polarised light. The ring antennae are rotated to steer the beam to coherently add incident radiation in groups of 22 antennae spanning approximately 4.7\,m. This is referred to as a ``module", and each arm possesses 176 of them. In the north-south direction the telescope can tilt and observe sources south of $\delta<17^\circ$. 
The incident radiation adds coherently to induce a voltage in a resonant cavity that is amplified by a low-noise amplifier (LNA) with a noise figure of 20-30K. Four adjacent modules for a ``bay'' and have their signals passed to the digital receiver or (RX) box.
