A pulsar timing program has already commenced, and the telescope will soon begin searching for fast radio bursts (FRBs), rotating radio transients (RRATs), and performing synthesis imaging. All of the FRBs discovered will be made immediately public as will the bulk of the radio pulsars being monitored for glitches and other timing irregularities.
