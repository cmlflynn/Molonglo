\subsection{Polyphase Filterbank}
The fibres from 16 modules are aggregated in a rear transmission module that takes the 8/10 encoded optical data and places it on Rocket IO to send it to the polyphase filterbank (PFB) boards. The PFBs have a CX4 port which can be used to send 10Gb ethernet packets to industry standard network interface cards. The PFB can be reprogrammed into one of three modes, pass-through, critically-sample PFB and over-sampled PFB. The pass-through mode was pivotal in debugging the more complex modes.
