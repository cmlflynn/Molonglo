\section{The UTMOST System Design}

The MOST consists of two parabolic cylinders 11.7\,m wide and 778\,m long separated by 15\,m. Parabolic cylinders enable a linear scaling of cost with collecting area but make steering the beam along its axis difficult. An block diagram of the system is provided in Figure 1.
