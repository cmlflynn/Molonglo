\subsection{Single Module Modes}
\subsubsection{Incoherent Pulsar Timing Mode}

In Figure XX we show pulsar timing residuals from the millisecond pulsar PSR J0437-4715 in incoherent mode over 20 days. The RMS residual is already just 2$\mu$s and the array was only operating at a few percent of theoretical peak efficiency during these observations. In the data the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array ephemeris was used and we didn't fit for any parameters.
