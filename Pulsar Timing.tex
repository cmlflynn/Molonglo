\subsection{Pulsar Timing (Fabian?)}

When completed the UTMOST will have the ability to time multiple pulsars within a primary beam and we estimate that it should be possible to time 100s of pulsars every week that will become an important database for studies of glitching pulsars and for the timing of the brightest millisecond pulsars for contribution to the International Pulsar Timing Array. The large fraction of the telescope time available will mean that it will be easy to prioritise long dwell times when pulsar scintillation is proving favourable.
