A software backend was proposed in early 2013 after it was realised we could tap off the data fairly early on in the digital signal processing chain, keeping the first two stages of the SKAMP-2 system but doing the rest of the processing on commodity CPUs and GPUs. UTMOST is designed to provide the ultimate in processing flexibility and provide commensal modes to enable simultaneous mapping, pulsar coherent dedispersion, burst-searching and baseband dump modes whilst employing novel intereference mitigation strategies.
