\subsection{Mapping (Shivani & Vikram?)}

For the first time, the Molonglo telescope will have enough redundancy to solve for the gains of every independent module to properly model the beam and allow proper calibration of the images. It will also have a spectral line mode and potentially be able to search for HI emission from the large scale structure of the Universe between 820-850 MHz where its spatial resolution is well-matched to the scale of anticipated structures.

Development of a future pulsar gating mode is in our plans, and Molonglo should have a good role to play in establishing positions for new pulsars and RRATS being discovered at the Parkes observatory.
