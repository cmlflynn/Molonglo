\subsection{Beam-forming}

After the corner-turn, the data are aligned in time in the RAM of the beam-forming servers, and all of the same frequency channels are co-located. At this point the servers can perform one of four different operations. They can form a single tied array beam, cross correlate each input against the others, produce fine channels that are correlated, or create fan beams.
