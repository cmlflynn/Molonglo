\subsection{Corner Turned Modes}
\subsubsection{Tied Array Beam Mode}

A tied array beam was formed on the Vela pulsar and the data written to disk after square law detection and integration up to 1 ms time resolution. In Figure X we show the individual pulses detected after dedispersion. 

\subsubsection{FX Correlation Mode}

In Figure X+3 we show the first map made with the system of the field surrounding the quasar XXXX-YYYY using 88 modules. The noise in the background image is XX mJy and the dynamic range better than XX dB.

\subsubsection{Fan Beam Mode}

The raw voltage dump mode was used to record voltages for 2 minutes on the field containing the Vela pulsar as it drifted through the primary beam. A series of fan beams were created at differing delays and passed through standard single pulse dedispersion codes. Figure Z shows the pulsar drifting in and out of a fan beam and being detected at the correct dispersion measure.
