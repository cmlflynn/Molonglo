We describe the deployment of a modern cluster of server-class computers at the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) that have transformed the instrument into a powerful new facility (UTMOST). The servers form part of a hybrid Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)/ Central Processing Unit (CPU)/ Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) solution to the radio astronomy signal processing problem. The emphasis on software has enabled extremely rapid deployment of the solution and re-use of many powerful existing "software backends" already proven at other observatories. UTMOST represents a dramatic increase in the scientific capabilities of the MOST. Its primary beam has four times the field of view, it uses an FX correlator rather than a multiplication interferometer to improve sensitivity by $2^{1/2}$ and provides the ability to perform self-cal to improve the dynamic range of maps, can
