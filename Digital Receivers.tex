\subsection{Receiver (RX) Boxes}
The 88 RX boxes apply a pair of analogue filters in series to each input to filter out a local telecommunications tower at 890 MHz and produce four band-limited signals from 830 to 862 MHz (CHECK) before downconversion from 800-900 MHz to 0-100 MHz. The signals are 8-bit complex sampled before being sent down four fibres using SERDES format from a Lattice FPGA.
