Individual, narrow radio bursts detected across the UTMOST primary beam. Lower panel : bursts from 1 to 32 ms were searched for, and are marked in grey (for SNR<10) and green (for SNR$\ge$10) as a function of time and fanbeam number. Vela is seen as events marked in blue, crossing 352 fanbeams tiled across the UTMOST primary beam. RFI, predominantly due to telephone handsets, is seen simultaneously in many fanbeams. Upper panel : dispersion measures (DM) for the burst events shown as a function of time, with the same colour coding as the lower panel. Vela is seen at its expected DM of $~$75 pc/cm$^{-3}$. The transit time through the beam is of order 20 minutes, and leads to detections of thousands of individual pulses, at a typical SN of 40. Only half the telescope collecting area was in use at the time of these observations (April 2015).
