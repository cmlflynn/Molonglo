Block diagram for the UTMOST system. Until the RX Box the system is identical to that used for the MOST. The SKAMP-2 upgrade hardware is used until the polyphase filterbank (PFB) stage. The UTMOST backend taps off the data from the PFB via 10 Gb ethernet and uses commoditity off the shelf (COTS) computing hardware and radio astronomy software to process the data.
