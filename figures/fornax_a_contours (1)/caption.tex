Fornax A, from a 9 hour observation of the source made in XXXX 2014. Only 1/4 of the telescope collecting area and a small fraction of the bandwidth were used to produce this image. A nearby phase calibrator was observed every 2 hours. The image noise ~ 5 mJy and is dominated by remaining artifacts rather than thermal noise. The contour levels are at -25, 25, 50, 75 â€¦ mJy.
