This paper describes the scientific capability and design of the ``UTMOST'', the Swinburne University of Technology CPU/GPU backend solution for the MOST. In section 2 we provide a block diagram and a give brief description of all of the system components and their technical specifications. Some examples of the new data monitoring capabilities are provided in section 3. The site is subject to interference from domestic mobile phones and communications towers, and a novel technique to detect and attenuate their signals are described in section 4. Examples of the major observing modes are provided in section 5, and the initial science programs are described in section 6. Finally, in section 7 we describe the current issues with the instrument and the hardware timetable for completion.
