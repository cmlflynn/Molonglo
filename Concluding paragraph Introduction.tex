This paper describes the scientific capability and design of the ``UTMOST'', the Swinburne University of Technology CPU/GPU backend for the MOST. In section 2 we provide a block diagram and a give brief description of all of the system components. Examples of the new data monitoring capabilities in section 3. The site is subject to interference from domestic mobile phones and communications towers, and a novel technique to detect and eliminate this is described in section 4. Examples of the major observing modes are provided in section 5, and the major initial science programs in section 6. Finally, in section 7 we describe the remaining issues with the instrument and the hardware timetable for completion.
